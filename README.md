Welcome to 'You Are Purrfect', an app where you can browse for your dream cat!

To get started, run the following command:
json-server --watch db.json --port 8000

Then run your standard npm install and npm start to view the webpage!

You will be sent to a default homepage, where you will see the NavBar at the top. There is also three images of some cute cats, and a button that displays 'View Breeds'. This has the same functionality as clicking the 'Breeds' icon on the NavBar, which will redirect you to an extensive list of cat breeds!

On this page, you may click on a breed of your choice and be presented with:

The name of the breed
An image of that cat!
A brief description summarizing that cat's traits
The common temperament of the breed
Affection Level, Child friendliness, Dog friendliness, energy level, and shedding level

You will be able to then add that breed to your favorites if you find it desirable. You can also toggle a search bar or filter options by clicking the corresponding icons at the top!

On your favorites page will be a list of your stored favorite cats. You can click 'see breed details' to be redirected back to that breed's full information card, or click 'remove' (why would you do this!) to take that cat off the array of favorites. 

Finally, there is a dark mode option, also found at the NavBar.

This website is for cat enthusiasts, or people looking for their dream cat. Please remember to do further research into breeds you are interested in, and we hope you enjoy the app!
